![release badge](https://github.com/jk-oster/obsidian-search-for-web/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg)

>‚ùónote that this extension requires the Obsidian REST API or OmniSearch Plugin installed!

## üîç Have a Evernote like search experience

For all of you who are missing the Evernote browser search extension in Obsidian - here is your solution. This extension lets you search your Obsidian Vault simultaneously as you type your search in your favourite search engine.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Web Clipper Companion

This extension is a perfect companion for the official [Obsidian Web Clipper Extension](https://obsidian.md/clipper). With the Official Web Clipper you can save content to your Obsidian Vault while browsing, and this extension will allow you to resurface these saved notes as you revisit the page later or type a search for it in your search engine.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ LIVE SEARCH: Search your vault for notes matching your current search in e.q. the google search bar
- ‚úÖ URL MATCHING: Search your vault for matches of your current url while browsing
- ‚úÖ EMBEDDED RESULTS: See your notes embedded in the search engine results
- ‚úÖ NOTE PREVIEW: Peek into the note contents without leaving the browser
- ‚úÖ Choose your favourite search provider Local REST API or OmniSearch Plugin
- ‚úÖ Scroll and open your matched Obsidian notes in the sidebar
- ‚úÖ Exclude files and folders you don't want to show up in the sidebar search

### üõ°Ô∏è Privacy

This extension just communicates between your local Obsidian REST Api and the browser.
The only data that is stored permanently in the browser are the settings including the Obsidian REST API-Key.

### üîé Search engines - embedding support

- google.com
- bing.com
- ecosia.org
- qwant.com

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Be aware this may change anytime if the search engines change layouts or technologies...

### üåê Browser compatibility

By using the webextension-polyfill library of mozilla.org it should also be compatible with Firefox though.
