# Why this extension?

## The Problem

Have you ever:
- 🔍 **Searched for something on Google** only to realize later that you already took notes on it?
- 📑 **Browsed a webpage and forgotten** that you’ve written something related in Obsidian?
- 🔗 **Wished your browser could automatically link** you to relevant notes while you explore the web?

If any of these sound familiar, **VaultLens is for you**.

That’s exactly what [VaultLens](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/obsidian-browser-search/ikdemlfoilfdmcdiegelchlhfnkpmaee) tries to solve. The extension resurfaces notes from your Obsidian vault while you browse the web, making your workflow smoother and more intuitive.

## Inspiration & Alternatives

When [Obsidian's Official Web Clipper](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/obsidian-web-clipper/cnjifjpddelmedmihgijeibhnjfabmlf) was released, it set a high standard for saving content. 
However, it didn’t focus on **resurfacing and searching notes directly within the browser**.

There are a few extensions out there that offer partial solutions:
- ✅ [Omnisearch Companion](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/omnisearch-companion/kcjcnnlpfbilodfnnkpioijobpjhokkd)
- ✅ [Obsidian Web](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/obsidian-web/edoacekkjanmingkbkgjndndibhkegad)
- ✅ [Simple Obsidian Note Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/simple-obsidian-note-exte/flohnmomnafamkgbjonnjcjggkhiokkn)
- ✅ [Search Obsidian in Google](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/search-obsidian-in-google/dkefnggaipjamcbnjdlapgilhlaikbme)

These are great tools, but none fully aligned with my **ideal note-taking workflow** — they either lacked usability, seamless integration, or key features.

### A Familiar Concept, Evolved for Obsidian
If you’ve used [Evernote’s Browser Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/evernote-web-clipper/pioclpoplcdbaefihamjohnefbikjilc), you might remember how it embedded notes into search results and helped you rediscover past ideas. 
[VaultLens](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/obsidian-browser-search/ikdemlfoilfdmcdiegelchlhfnkpmaee) takes this further, letting you:
- 💡 See relevant notes in search results (Google, Bing, etc.)
- 📖 Preview notes before opening them
- 🔗 Automatically resurface notes of related webpages

With this extension, **your notes work for you — without extra effort**.

## The Solution
- 🚀 [VaultLens](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/obsidian-browser-search/ikdemlfoilfdmcdiegelchlhfnkpmaee) makes your second brain smarter.
- 💡 It helps you rediscover past insights effortlessly.
- 🔎 It keeps you focused by bringing the right notes to you, at the right time.
