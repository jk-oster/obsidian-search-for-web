# Data Privacy Statement

> This extension is an **open source project**. Users are invited to inspect the source code themselves in the [extensions github repository](https://github.com/jk-oster/obsidian-search-for-web).

This Data Privacy Statement outlines the handling of user data by the **Vault Lens** extension. It is essential to review and understand this policy, as it governs the collection, use, and sharing of user data. By using the extension, you agree to the terms outlined below.

## Extension Permissions

This extension uses the following extension permission to work correctly:

- ðŸ’¾ ``storage``: This is required to store your settings and preferences.
- ðŸ“‘ ``tabs``: Access and modify browser tabs. This is required to show the sidebar and embed search results in the page.
- ðŸ”— ``host permissions``: Access to the current page URL. This is required to match URLs and show relevant notes.

## Collection of User Data

The extension does not collect any user data, such as personal information or usage statistics. It does not store any data on the user's device, and all data is handled in memory.

It only sends the search query to a obsidian service locally running on the users machine to retrieve the search results.

## Use of User Data

The extension does not use any user data for any purpose other than to provide its functionality. No user data except extension settings is stored on the user's device, and all data from the obsidian notes is handled locally in memory.

Search results and note content are embedded in the host page on purpose and are therefore accessibile to the host page or any scripts running on it.

## Access to Privacy Policy

A direct link to the privacy policy is provided on the [Chrome Web Store Detailpage](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/obsidian-browser-search/ikdemlfoilfdmcdiegelchlhfnkpmaee) for transparency and easy reference.

It is the user's responsibility to review the privacy policy before using the extension. Any updates or changes to the privacy policy will be reflected in the designated area, and users are encouraged to check periodically for updates.

If you have any concerns or questions regarding the privacy policy or extension permissions, please contact me at [jakobosterberger.com/contact](https://jakobosterberger.com/contact).
