# Data Privacy Statement

This Data Privacy Statement outlines the handling of user data by the VaultLens extension. It is essential to review and understand this policy, as it governs the collection, use, and sharing of user data. By using the extension, you agree to the terms outlined below.

## Collection of User Data

The extension does not collect any user data, such as personal information or usage statistics. It does not store any data on the user's device, and all data is handled in memory.

It only sends the search query to a obsidian service locally running on the users machine to retrieve the search results.

## Use of User Data

The extension does not use any user data for any purpose other than to provide its functionality. No user data except extension settings is stored on the user's device, and all data is handled in memory.

## Access to Privacy Policy

The complete and up-to-date privacy policy can be accessed through the designated Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard field. A direct link to the privacy policy is provided for transparency and easy reference.

It is the user's responsibility to review the privacy policy before using the extension. Any updates or changes to the privacy policy will be reflected in the designated area, and users are encouraged to check periodically for updates.
