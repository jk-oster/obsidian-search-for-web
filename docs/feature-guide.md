## Connection Indicator

When the extension could establish a successful connection with your Obsidian search provider the extension icon will have a green or no indicator attached.
If the extension could not reach Obsidian then there will be a gray indicator visible next to the extension icon.
To get more information about why the extension could not reach Obsidian open the sidebar or the extension settings.

## 📑 Sidebar

The sidebar will always be reachable on any webpage you navigate.
Here you will find search results matching the page or you can also use it to type a search query directly in the sidebar.

### Opening the Sidebar

By default, the extension sidebar can be opened by hovering the extension icon on the page.
As soon as you leave the extension sidebar with your mouse again it will be hidden again.

### Pinning the Sidebar

You can keep the sidebar permanently opened by "pinning" it. You can toggle the "pinned"/"unpinned" states by clicking
the button in the sidebar header, or click the extension icon in the browser.
