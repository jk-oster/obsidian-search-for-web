# Feature Guide

> [!warning] Work in Progress üèóÔ∏è
> This page is a work in progress and does not include all the features yet!

## Connection Indicator

When the extension could establish a successful connection with your Obsidian search provider the extension icon will have a green or no indicator attached.
If the extension could not reach Obsidian then there will be a gray indicator visible next to the extension icon.
To get more information about why the extension could not reach Obsidian open the sidebar or the extension settings.

## üìë Sidebar

The sidebar will always be reachable on any webpage you navigate.
Here you will find search results matching the page or you can also use it to type a search query directly in the sidebar.

### Opening the Sidebar

By default, the extension sidebar can be opened by hovering the extension icon on the page.
As soon as you leave the extension sidebar with your mouse again it will be hidden again.

### Pinning the Sidebar <Badge type="tip" text="^2.0.0" />

You can keep the sidebar permanently opened by "pinning" it. You can toggle the "pinned"/"unpinned" states by clicking
the button in the sidebar header, or click the extension icon in the browser. 

## ‚ö° Instant Live Search  <Badge type="tip" text="^1.0.0" />

The main feature of this extension is the live search. As you type your search in a search engine the extension will fetch the search results from your Obsidian Vault and display them in the sidebar. The search results are updated as you type and you can scroll through them to find the note you are looking for.

![Screenshot live search](./img/live-search.png)

You can configure live search behavior in the extension settings. You can choose the domains on which the extension should look for search input and trigger the live search. All other pages will be matched by URL instead of search input.

The extension automatically recognizes the following search engines for live search without any additional configuration:

- google.com
- bing.com
- kagi.com
- duckduckgo.com
- baidu.com
- search.brave.com
- startpage.com
- search.yahoo.com
- qwant.com
- ecosia.org
- yandex.com

## ‚úÖ Url Matching  <Badge type="tip" text="^1.0.0" />

If you are currently on a page that you have saved in your Obsidian Vault somewhere the extension will automatically show you all notes that contain the URL of this page in the sidebar. This feature is particularly helpful for locating notes tied to specific websites. Or if you want to see if you have already taken notes on a page you are currently reading. The URL matching is only triggered if the current page does NOT match a configured live search domain in the settings.

## üñ•Ô∏è Embedded Search Results <Badge type="tip" text="^1.4.0" />

![Screenshot embedded search results](./img/embedded-results.png)

This extension supports embedded search results on the following search engines:
- google.com (native styled embeddings)
- bing.com (native styled embeddings)
- kagi.com (native styled embeddings)
- duckduckgo.com (native styled embeddings)
- baidu.com (generic embeddings)
- search.yahoo.com (generic embeddings)
- qwant.com (generic embeddings)
- ecosia.org (generic embeddings)
- yandex.com (generic embeddings)

If the extension detects that a the user is on one of those search engines it will automatically embed the search results in the search page sidebar or main content block. Embedded search results can be toggled on or off in the settings.

Evaluated and not supported are:
- search.brave.com
- startpage.com

## üëÄ Quick Note Preview <Badge type="tip" text="^2.1.0" />

![Screenshot note preview](./img/preview.png)

## ‚úíÔ∏è Note Editing and Appending Content <Badge type="tip" text="^2.1.0" />

Opened noptes can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button in the preview panel. A code mirror view of your note will be loaded in which you can conviniently change the content of your note. The edited content will be saved automatically if the panel is closed with the "X"-close button or when the mode is changed to "Preview" or "Append".

![Screenshot note editing](./img/editing.png)

## üåî Adaptive Dark / Light Mode

The extension has four theme modes:
- Auto
- Device
- Light
- Dark

In "auto" mode the extension tries to auto detect the current color scheme of the page. Depending on the brightness it will choose the best fitting color scheme.

In "device" mode it will use the device color scheme preference for the sidebar and auto detection for embedded content.

In "light" or "dark" mode are chosen then those are enforced no matter the page background or device preferences.

## üîç Configurable Search


## üìÖ Daily Note Quick Access  <Badge type="tip" text="^2.2.0" />


## üîó Link Hover Messages <Badge type="tip" text="^2.2.0" />

> This feature is heavily inspired by [Obsidian Web](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-web) (lots of kudos) and aims for compatibility while adding a few nice add-ons

You can configure Obsidian Browser Search to alert you when the link you are hovering over has a dedicated note (see Page Notes) or has been mentioned on a note. Once enabled and you hover over such a link, a message will be displayed next to your mouse cursor (see ...).

Some frontmatter fields can be used to control what information is shown in this message:

- ``web-message``: This message will be displayed in the hover and page note message.
- ``web-badge-color``: By default, circle on the left side of the hover message is yellow or blue depending upon whether the linked URL is found to have a dedicated note or was just mentioned in a note. You can set this color explicitly by setting this color; see Special Frontmatter Fields for more information.
- ``web-badge-icon``: You can define an emoji / text that will be displayes inside the badge.
- ``web-badge-message``: This short message will be displayed in the hover message alongside the longer web-message.

## üóíÔ∏è Dedicated Page Note Messages <Badge type="tip" text="^2.2.0" />

> This feature is heavily inspired by [Obsidian Web](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-web) (lots of kudos) and aims for compatibility while adding a few nice add-ons

For many features of Obsidian Browser Search, it can be helpful to associate a particular URL or set of URLs with a note. To establish this connection, you can use the url or ``url-aliases`` frontmatter fields as described below. Once you have done so and you navigate to a URL you have created notes for, Obsidian Browser Search will suggest the linked note to you and, if enabled, show you a message:

```yaml
---
url: https://www.amazon.com/Zenkeeper-Obsidian-Tumbling-Meditation-Sculpture/dp/B08L3LWVKV/*
---
```

or

```yaml
---
link: https://www.amazon.com/Zenkeeper-Obsidian-Tumbling-Meditation-Sculpture/dp/B08L3LWVKV/*
---
```

The ``url`` / `link` field also supports using the ``*`` symbol as a wildcard so you can match multiple URLs. You can see this in use in the above example so that we match that URL regardless of what parameters are added to the URL.

In some cases, you might need a particular note to be responsible for multiple URLs, if so, you can put any number of URLs in the ``url-aliases`` field:

```yaml
---
url-aliases:
  - https://livethedraper.com/*
  - https://www.apartments.com/5035-n-broadway-st-chicago-il/1gh5s77
  - https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Draper+-+Uptown/*
---
```

or

```yaml
---
link-aliases:
  - https://livethedraper.com/*
  - https://www.apartments.com/5035-n-broadway-st-chicago-il/1gh5s77
  - https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Draper+-+Uptown/*
---
```

Like url above, this supports using the ``*`` character for matching multiple URLs.

## ‚≠ê Choose Search Provider <Badge type="tip" text="^1.4.0" />

To fetch search results from your Obsidian Vault you can choose between the Obsidian Local REST API Plugin or the Omni Search Plugin. The extensions requires one of these plugins to be installed and enabled in your Obsidian Vault.

If you use the Omni Search Plugin make sure to enable the HTTP Server API in the settings of the plugin.

In case you are using the Obsidian Local REST API Plugin you need to copy the API-Key from the obsidian plugin the settings and enter it in the extension options.

> [!info]
> If your want to use the Note Preview feature the [Obsidian Local REST Api](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-local-rest-api) is required.
> However, you can use both plugins simultaneously. The extension allows you to use Omnisearch for search results and REST Api for the note preview at the same time. *Best of both worlds ü§©*

> [!tip]
> If you work with non-Latin scripts such as Chinese or Japanese, consider using the Obsidian Local REST API Plugin for better search results.
